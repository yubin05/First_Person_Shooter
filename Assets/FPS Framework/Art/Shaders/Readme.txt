To convert to HDRP, import the package at 'FPS Framework/Packages/HDRP Convertor'

To convert to BIRP, change all materials to Standard shader, and all sights to Sight_BIRP
For the camera set the overlay camera to DepthOnly and increase its depth value.

The scopes will be using dual renderer, until stencil comes to the asset in 2.0 update for HDRP and BIRP.
